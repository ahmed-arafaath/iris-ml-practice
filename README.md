The Iris classification is a classical dataset to get introduced with the concepts of machine learning and exploratory data analysis.
The dataset contains different length and width of three Iris species. The task would be to build a machine learning model to predict the Iris flower species based on the petal & sepal width/length.

## Purpose
Through this project, I learned to analyze and visualize dataset, I also gained exposure to machine learning classification concepts.
I gained experience using Scikit learn, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib.


Accuracy achieved - 96% with logistic regression.
